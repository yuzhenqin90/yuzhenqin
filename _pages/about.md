I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Machine Learning and Neural Computing in [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en), the Netherlands. I am also a member of Dutch Brain Interface Initiative ([DBI2](https://dbi2.nl/about-dbi2)), a multi-institude consortium backed by a substantial 10-year grant totaling â‚¬ 21.9M. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Dec. 2019 from [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl), the Netherlands, advised by [Prof. Ming Cao](https://www.rug.nl/staff/m.cao/). I received my M.E. from Wuhan University in 2015. From 2020 to 2023, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Prof. Fabio Pasqualetti](https://www.fabiopas.it/index.html) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering  at the University of California, Riverside.
